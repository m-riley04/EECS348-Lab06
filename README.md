## Author: Riley Meyerkorth

## Objective
Get familiar with an IDE, C++ programming. You will also learn how to push your projects from the Git repository to GitHub. You will implement some functions for the C++ programming part, and you can find details from the source codes.

## Functionality
1. Read values from a file into 2 matrices (2D Arrays)
2. Print the matrices
3. Add two matrices and place the result in a third matrix
4. Multiply two matrices and place the result in a third matrix
5. Subtract the second matrix from the first matrix and place the result in a third matrix

## Constraints
The matrices are square matrices (NxN), where N is defined as a static constant. The input matrices are read from a file named "matrix_input.txt". The output matrices are displayed on the console. Place only the functional prototypes before the main function. Place the function bodies below the main program.
